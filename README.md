# Foot-Size-Detection

## Foot Size Detection using Python and OpenCV
This project uses basic computer vision techniques to detect the size of a foot in an image using Python and OpenCV. The code takes an image as input and outputs the size of the bounding rectangle around the foot in the image.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need:

Python 3.0 or higher
OpenCV 3.0 or higher

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/MahdiNavaei/foot-size-detection.git


## Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Put your foot image in the same directory as the foot_size_detection.py file.
Run the foot_size_detection.py file:

python foot_size_detection.py

The code will display the foot image with a bounding rectangle around the detected foot and print the foot size in pixels to the console.
